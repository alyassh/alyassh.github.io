          <h3>Welcome to my blog!</h3>
          <p>Hi there! I'm alyas.sh, a french passionate cybersecurity enthusiast and a dedicated penetration tester. Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by the world of technology and the art of hacking.</p>
          <p>To make my skills something valuable, I decided to dive deep into the world of ethical hacking and security research. I've been actively participating in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, where I get to put my skills to the test and uncover vulnerabilities in simulated environments.</p>
          <p>On this website, you'll find a collection of my CTF write-ups, where I document the steps I took to solve different challenges. My goal is to share my knowledge and insights with the broader cybersecurity community, hoping to inspire and educate others who are interested in this field.</p>
          <p>Feel free to explore my CTF write-ups, and join me in this thrilling pursuit of securing our digital future.</p>
