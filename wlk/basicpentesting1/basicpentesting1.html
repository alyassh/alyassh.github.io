          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Basic Pentesting 1 is a begginer friendly machine, which only requires common sense and basic pentesting tools to get rooted. Lets' hop into the walkthrough !</p>
		  <br />
          <h3>Recon</h3>
		  <p>The first thing to do here is to do a classic <strong>nmap</strong> scan on the host. Like always, we are going to use the "-sC" and "sV" parameters to get the complete informations of the machine, and the detailled versions of the active services.</p>
          <img src="1.png" />
		  <p>Here, 3 main services are detected as open. There is <strong>FTP</strong>, <strong>SSH</strong>, and <strong>HTTP</strong>.<br />
          As SSH and HTTP are very commonly activated on these types of machines, we are going to focus on the <strong>FTP</strong> service, that appears to be on a sketchy version, <strong>ProFTPD 1.3.3c</strong>.</p>
		  <br />
          <h3>Exploitation</h3>
		  <p> Now that we know which service to focus on, we are going to use the <strong>Metasploit Framework</strong> to automate the backdooring process into the vulnerable machine, by exploiting this FTP version.</p>
		  <p> Let's run <strong>msfconsole</strong> to start the framework on our machine.<br />
		  Then, type in <strong>searchsploit proftpd 1.3.3c</strong> to search if any exploit related to this version exists in Metasploit.</p>
		  <img src="2.png" height="533" width="753"/>
		  <p>Bingo! We can see that metasploit owns an exploit that can automate the procces of backdooring a website that hosts this service.<br />
		  Now, run <strong>use 0</strong> to use this exploit.</p>
		  <p> When typing <strong>info</strong> to show the parameters that are set and that need to be set, whe can notice <strong>RHOSTS</strong> (the IP address of the target machine) that needs to be filled up.<br />
		  Just type <strong> set RHOSTS [IP ADRESS OF THE TARGET]</strong> to set it up.</p>
		  <p> Next, we just need to select which payload will be used to backdoor the machine. You can choose the one you want, but for this tutorial we are going to use <strong>cmd/unix/bind_perl</strong>, by entering <strong>set payload cmd/unix/bind_perl</strong></p>
		  <p> Finally, let's run <strong>exploit</strong> to take control over the machine!</p>
		  <img src="3.png" />
		  <p>And bingo ! Now, we have a full remote control access over the victims machine :)<br />
		  Let's run <strong>whoami</strong> to confirm which user are we logged onto, and for here we are root !!</p>
		  <p>We now have to run <strong>ls</strong> to list all the files in our current directory, and figuring out that a file named "<strong>passwd</strong>" exists, let's run <strong>cat passwd</strong> to show the final flag ! :D</p>
